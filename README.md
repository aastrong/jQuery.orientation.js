orientation.js
==============

This is a very simple & lightweight jQuery plugin which detects the orientation of an attributes you desire - and adds and appropriate class name ( Portrait, Landscape & Square).

Simply add the orientation.js file to the bottom of your file, and intialize the plugin on what ever images, divs or elements you desire. ( look at example below )

	<script src="min/jquery.imageorientation.min.js"></script>
	<script>
	$(window).on('load', function() {
		$('img').orientation();
	});
	</script>

I have included an index.html as page as an example if need be. 

Any feedback is greatly apprciated.
