orientation.js
==============

This is a very simple & lightweight jQuery plugin which detects the orientation of an attributes you desire. 

Simply add the orientation.js file to the bottom of your file, and intialize the plugin on what ever images, divs or elements you desire. ( look at example below )

	<script src="min/jquery.imageorientation.min.js"></script>
	<script>
	$(window).on('load', function() {
		$('img').orientation();
	});
	</script>

I have included an index.html as page as an example if need be. 

Any feedback is greatly apprciated.
